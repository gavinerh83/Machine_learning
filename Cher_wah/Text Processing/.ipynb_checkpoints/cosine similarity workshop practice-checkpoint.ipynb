    "\t\"The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are.\",\n",
    "\t\"To see the world, things dangerous to come to. To see behind walls, to draw closer. To find each other and to feel. That, is the purpose of life.\",\n",
    "\t\"We should count time by heart throbs. He most lives who thinks most, feels the noblest, acts the best.\",\n",
    "\t\"Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence, is the key to unlocking our potential.\",\n",
    "\t\"Knowledge is knowing what to say. Wisdom is knowing when to say it.\",\n",

    "\t\"What hurts more, the pain of hard work or the pain of regret?\",\n",
    "\t\"Those who have achieved all their aims probably set them too low.\",\n",
    "\t\"What we fight with is so small, and when we win, it makes us small. What we want is to be defeated, decisively, by successively greater things.\",\n",
    "\t\"Life is the sum of our choices.\",\n",
    "\t\"To talk well and eloquently is a very great art, but it is an equally great one to know the right time to stop.\",\n",

    "\t\"Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and behold the view. Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you.\",\n",
    "\t\"The mark of a successful man is one that has spent an entire day on the bank of a river without feeling guilty about it.\",\n",

    "\t\"A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval.\",\n",
    "\t\"There are two things to aim at in life: first, to get what you want; and, after that, to enjoy it. Only the wisest of mankind achieve the second.\",\n",
    "\t\"We all make decisions, but in the end, our decisions made us.\",\n",
    "\t\"He who establishes his argument by noise and command shows that his reason is weak.\",\n",
